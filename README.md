Analysis 

In general, we believe a faster speed didn't decrease comprehension. The results don't fully show that because the tectonics quiz may 
have been a bit more difficult. We think a larger sample size and more standardized testing environment would make the results better, 
as would reading assignments of topics people were not already familiar with.
